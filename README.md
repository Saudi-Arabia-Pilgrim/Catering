## 🚀 Getting Started

## 📦 Dependency Management

Our project uses a structured approach to managing dependencies across different environments:

### 📄 Requirements Files Structure

- **`base.txt`**:
  - Core dependencies required across all environments.
  - Foundation for all other requirement files.
  - Contains essential packages for basic functionality.

- **`dev.txt`**:
  - Developer-specific tools and libraries.
  - Extends `base.txt`.
  - Includes debugging tools and development utilities.
  - Recommended for local development.

- **`test.txt`**:
  - Testing-related dependencies.
  - Extends `base.txt`.
  - Contains testing frameworks and assertion libraries.
  - Used in CI/CD pipelines.

- **`prod.txt`**:
  - Production-specific dependencies.
  - Extends `base.txt`.
  - Includes optimized libraries and production servers.
  - Example: gunicorn, optimized database connectors.

- **`local.txt`** *(Optional)*:
  - For local overrides or private dependencies.
  - Extends `dev.txt`.
  - Perfect for team-specific or developer-specific packages.
  - Not tracked in version control.
